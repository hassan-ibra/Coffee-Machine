# a coffee machine simulator. 
This machine uses regular ingredients â€” coffee, milk, and plastic cups. 
Should it run out of something, it will show you a notification. 
Our device will serve espresso, cappuccino, and latte. And since nothing is for free, it will also charge coffee lovers for a cup.
